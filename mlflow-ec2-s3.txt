1- strat ec2 instance with full access to s3
2- connect via ssh
3- isntall nginx
4- start ngninx server: sudo systemctl start nginx
4- configure nginx:
	a- sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
	b- under server configuration:
		remove all configuration under server name until the second curly bracket
	c- add the routing loacation as follow:
		location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;}
	d- sava the new configuration
	e- restart nginx: sudo systemctl restart nginx

5- install mlflow: sudo pip3 install mlflow
6- install awscli: sudo pip3 install awscli
7- install boto3:  sudo pip3 install boto3

8- go through step 8 if you do not have full access over S3 from ec2

8- configure aws cli:
	a- aws configure:
		ID: Your programatic access id 
		Key: your programatic access key
		region: region at which the instance operate
		output format: json
		

9- launch the mlflow server and specify the S3 Bucket to store artifacts on:
	mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --default-artifact-root s3://trainingoutput2021/logs1/
	
10- copy the puplic ec2 ip or DNS addresses and paste it to your browser:
	x.xx.xx.xxx:5000
	
11- Congratulation you have succefully setup mlflow on ec2 with s3 artifact store.

12- setup the tarcking uri in your training code using the ec2 instanc puplic DNS address as follow:
	mlflow.set_tracking_uri('http://ec2-x-xx-xx-xxx.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:5000/')

13- ensure that boto3 is installed where training code is hosted

14- export your aws credentials where your training code is hosted:
	export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-aws-access-key-id>
	export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-aws-secret-access-key>
